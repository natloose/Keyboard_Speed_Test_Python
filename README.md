# Python Keyboard Speed Test

This project will calculate your keyboard typing speed through Words Per Minute(WPM).

1. Press START to receive a randomly selected sentence that you must write down in the input section below in as quick as time as possible. 
2. Once finished you can either click the STOP! button or click ENTER on your keyboard to stop.
3. If your input is equal to the randomly generated sentence then your time and WPM will be displayed with a success message.
   If your input does not equal the randomly generated sentence you will recieve a "nice" feedback message letting you know.
